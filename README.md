About the Project
GANs are powerful neural networks capable of generating realistic data, but their training process is often unstable and prone to mode collapse. This repository explores improvements to GAN training and architecture, including:

Enhanced loss functions.
Improved generator and discriminator architectures.
Training techniques for better convergence.
Applications in image synthesis, style transfer, and beyond.
This project is inspired by advancements in the field and aims to bridge gaps between theoretical research and practical implementation.

Features
Advanced Architectures: Includes implementations of DCGAN, WGAN-GP, StyleGAN, and others.
Custom Loss Functions: Test and evaluate new loss functions for improved stability.
Data Augmentation: Integrate pre-processing pipelines to improve training data quality.
Metrics Evaluation: Tools to assess GAN performance using metrics like FID and Inception Score.
Training Visualization: Real-time monitoring of loss curves and generated outputs.
